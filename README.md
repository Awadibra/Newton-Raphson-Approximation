# Newton-Raphson-Approximation
find a single root of a polynomial of complex coefficients based on the Newton-Raphson approximation algorithm over complex numbers.  
The input to the program:  
The program shall read from stdin the following items:  
• A specification of tolerance (how close must we get to an actual zero
of the function)  
• A specification of the order (highest power in the polynomial)  
• The coeffcients (since they are indexed, these may be given in any order)  
• An initial value z with which to start the computation  
Below you shall find a sample input:  
Sample input:  
2  
epsilon = 1.0e-8  
order = 2  
coeff 2 = 2.0 0.0  
coeff 1 = 5.0 0.0  
coeff 0 = 3.0 0.0  
initial = 1.0 -1.0  
The blanks around the equal (=) sign are intentional and mandatory.
